* About
This is a karma plugin (framework) which extends jasmine version 2 to allow some
of old tests to pass. It prints deprecation warnings at the end of test run.

There are breaking changes, though, which cannot be shimed:
- Clock needs to be removed after usage with =jasmine.clock.uninstall()=.
- =runs()= and =waitsFor()= are gone, replaced by =done= callback.
- Object equality assertion is stricter in Jasmine 2 regarding keys with
  =undefined= value. This means that =toEqual()=, =toHaveBeenCalledWith()=,
  similar matchers will fail in cases like =expect({}).toEqual({ a: undefined
  });=.

See how to migrate here: http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/upgrading.html

* Usage
Add =jasmine1-shim= to =karma.conf.js=

#+begin_src javascript
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    // ...

    // Optional as "plugins" is populated automatically.
    plugins: [
      'karma-jasmine',
      'karma-jasmine1-shim'
    ],
    frameworks: ['jasmine', 'jasmine1-shim'],

    // ...
  });
};
#+end_src
